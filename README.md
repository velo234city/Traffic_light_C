# Traffic Light Simulation (C Program)

THis project demonstrates a " Traffic Light control system " using C programming in a PC console.

## Project Structure

- simulation: PC console simulation of traffic light ("traffic_light.c")
- STM32: STM32 Blue Pill version ( to be added later)
- arduino: Arduino sketch( to be added later)
- README.md: Project documentation

## Features

- Simulates Red, Yellow, and Green lights in sequence
- Console output shows the light status
- Modular code ready for embedded system adaptation

## How to Run
-Open the "traffic_light.c" file in your preferred C compiler(e.g GCC,Code::Blocks,Visual Studio)
-Compile and run the program.
-Observe the traffic light sequence in the console


## Future Work

- Implement STM32 Blue Pill version using GPIOs
- Implement Arduino version using LEDs and digital pins
- Add interrupt-based and timed control for realistic simulation
